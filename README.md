# DSA-Prep-Course

Contains assignments from Rutgers DSA (CS112) course. I'm redoing these for a good refresher on DSA. Feel free to follow along (my code is commented heavily for greater understanding).

### Project 3: Trie

This project involves building a tree structure called PrefixTree for a dictionary of English words, and use the PrefixTree to generate completeWordList(list of words starting with the given prefix) for string searches.
